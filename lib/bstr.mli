(** A small library for manipulating bigstrings.

    A bigstring is a mutable data structure that contains a fixed-length
    sequence of bytes. Each byte can be indexed in constant time for reading and
    writing.

    Given a byte sequence [bstr] of length [len], we can access each of the
    [len] bytes of [bstr] via its index in the sequence. Indexes start at [0],
    and will call an index valid in [bstr] if it falls within the range
    [[0...len-1]] (inclusive). A position is the point between two bytes or at
    the beginning or end of the sequence. We call a position valid in [bstr] if
    it falls within the range [[0...len]] (inclusive). Note that byte at index
    [n] is between positions [n] and [n+1].

    Two parameters [off] and [len] are said to designate a valid range of [bstr]
    if [len >= 0] and [off] and [off+len] are valid positions in [bstr].

    Byte sequences can be modified in place, for instance via the {!val:set} and
    {!val:blit} functions described below.

    {1:bigarray Bigstrings & Bigarrays.}

    Bigstring is a specialised version of {!module:Bigarray} that not only
    handles bytes in the form of {!module:Char}acter but also imposes a "C-like"
    (see {!val:Bigarray.c_layout}) view as described above and allows common
    functions such as [memcpy(3)] or [memmove(3)] to be offered.

    For more details about Bigstrings and Bigarrays, we invite you to read the
    {!module:Bigarray} documentation, which offers more general functions that
    can be applied to Bigstrings.

    {1:bytes Bigstrings & Bytes.}

    Like bytes, a bigstring is a mutable data structure that contains a
    fixed-length sequence of bytes. However, a bigstring has a few special
    features that can make it more interesting to use than bytes.

    {2:location Bigstrings and the Garbage Collector.}

    A bigstring is not allocated in the same way as a standard OCaml value. In
    fact, the byte sequence that the bigstring refers to is found in the
    {i C heap} (rather than the OCaml heap). This means that the byte sequence
    can come from a [malloc(3)] or a function requesting a particular memory
    area from the system such as [Unix.map_file].

    This particularity has an implication with the GC: the byte sequence is
    {b not relocatable}. That is to say that during the cycle of the Garbage
    Collector, this byte sequence does not move — in contrast, a [bytes] can be
    moved by the GC (typically, from the minor heap to the major heap).

    Thus, bigstrings have advantages and disadvantages compared to bytes due to
    this particularity:
    - Creating a bigstring can be expensive. Whether it is with
      [malloc(3)]/{!val:create} or [Unix.map_file], creating a bigstring will
      always be more expensive than creating bytes with OCaml. For small byte
      sequences, it is therefore preferable to use bytes.
    - Since a bigstring cannot be moved, its position can be shared by [Thread]s
      and/or [Domain]s without interacting with the GC. An example is being able
      to perform a complex computation in parallel from the bytes of this
      sequence without {i blocking} the Garbage Collector during this
      computation.

    Depending on these characteristics, it may be more advantageous to use a
    bigstring rather than [bytes]. This basically depends on your usage, and the
    special features of bigstrings can unlock opportunities to outperform byte
    calculations or analysis.

    {2:sub Bigstring and slice.}

    Another advantage of bigstrings is that copying is avoided when extracting
    part of a larger bigstring. This is because the {!val:sub} function returns
    a "proxy" of the original bigstring.

    In this respect, and to be very precise, {!val:sub} avoids copying but the
    creation of this "proxy" {b remains} costly. In addition, this library is
    distributed with a new {!module:Slice_bstr} module. The latter offers a new
    type whose {!val:Slice_bstr.sub} function is much less costly than
    {!val:sub}. *)

val memcpy : t -> src_off:int -> t -> dst_off:int -> len:int -> unit
(** [memcpy src ~src_off dst ~dst_off ~len] copies [len] bytes from [src] to
    [dst]. [src] {b must not} overlap [dst]. Use {!val:memmove} if [src] & [dst]
    do overlap.

    You can check whether two buffers overlap using {!val:overlap}. If this
    returns [None], the two values do not refer to a common memory area — and it
    is safe to use memcpy.

    @raise Invalid_argument
      if [src_off] and [len] do not designate a valid range of [src], or if
      [dst_off] and [len] do not designate a valid range of [dst]. *)

val memcpy_mmaped : t -> src_off:int -> t -> dst_off:int -> len:int -> unit
(** [memcpy_mmaped] is like {!val:memcpy} but [src] and [dst] can be a

    from one to the other can take some time because it involves reading/writing
    to disk. The operation can take longer than if the two bigarrays were
    allocated via [malloc()]/Bigarray.Array1.create.

    It may therefore be worthwhile to release the GC lock so that this specific
    operation can be carried out in parallel (in a [Thread]) without
    interruption by the GC.

    Note that the bigarrays do not necessarily need to be {i mmaped}. This
    function also applies to "normal" bigarrays. It may also be worthwhile to
    use this function if you know that you are copying a large area and would
    like to do it in parallel (in a [Thread]). *)

    in [src] are first copied into a temporary array that does not overlap [src]
    or [dst], and the bytes are then copied from the temporary array to [dst].

    @raise Invalid_argument

val split_on_char : char -> t -> t list
(** [split_on_char sep t] is the list of all (possibly empty)
    {!val:sub}-bigstrings of [t] that are delimited by the character [sep]. If
    [t] is empty, the result is the singleton list [[empty]].

    The function's result is specified by the following invariant:
    - the list is not empty.
    - concatenating its elements using [sep] as a separator returns a bigstring
      equal to the input.
    - no bigstring in the result contains the [sep] character. *)

val concat : string -> t list -> t
(** [concat sep ts] concatenates the list of bigstrings [ts], inserting the
    separator string [sep] between each. *)

val iter : (char -> unit) -> t -> unit
(** [iter fn t] applies function [fn] in turn to all the characters of [t]. It
    is equivalent to [fn t.{0}; fn t.{1}; ...; fn t.{length t - 1}; ()]. *)

val to_seq : t -> char Seq.t
(** Iterate on the bigstring, in increasing index order. Modifications of the
    bigstring during iteration will be reflected in the sequence. *)

val to_seqi : t -> (int * char) Seq.t
(** Iterate on the bigstring, in increasing order, yielding indices along chars.
*)

val of_seq : char Seq.t -> t
(** Create a bigstring from the generator. *)
